			<title>SCHALCK TAKES GOLD; VAN DUYSEN CLAIMS BELGIUM'S FIRST EVER IFSC WORLD CUP MEDAL</title>
			<link>https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/news/921-schalck-takes-gold-van-duysen-claims-belgium-s-first-ever-ifsc-world-cup-medal</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/news/921-schalck-takes-gold-van-duysen-claims-belgium-s-first-ever-ifsc-world-cup-medal</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cdn.ifsc-climbing.org/images/News/2023/04_APR/230423_IFSC_News_Schalck_takes_gold_Van_Duysen_claims_Belgiums_first_ever_World_Cup_medalPREV.jpg" /></p><p>France’s Mejdi Schalck took one of two French medals at the IFSC World Cup Hachioji 2023 as Belgian teenager Hannes Van Duysen made history with a first ever World Cup medal for the nation.</p>

<p>Schalck was appearing in his 11<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;IFSC World Cup and claimed his second gold medal at the&nbsp;Esforta Arena Hachioji.</p>
<p>The Frenchman took two finals tops, the only climber to do so, and finished ahead of history maker Van Duysen and teammate Paul Jenft who took bronze.</p>
<p>Talking of his win Schalck said: <em>“I’m very happy with the gold as it’s been a big goal I have been training for over winter. I wanted to win a second medal to show myself I could do it.”</em></p>
<p>With compatriot Jenft on the podium, Schalck appreciates the strong training position they are in together: <em>“We have trained together for about five or six years and the ‘rivalry’ pushes us on to the top. We push each other and it is a really good rivalry for the both of us.”</em></p>
<p>Despite the chance to make history, Van Duysen could have felt the weight of pressure on him, especially in only his fifth appearance at an IFSC World Cup, but instead he used the excitement to his advantage: <em>“It’s the first time for Belgium to get a medal so that’s pretty cool. It’s amazing to be here and every round was incredible for me.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>“I was excited to be in the semi-final and then I didn’t have any pressure, so I just climbed how I wanted to and made the final. Then to end up on the podium is very crazy.”</em></p>
<p>Only&nbsp;the second Belgian to make an IFSC Boulder World Cup final, Van Duysen reflected on a debut year in 2022 to focus and progress through the winter, and it paid off: <em>“I competed in a few World Cups last year, but I made a lot of silly mistakes, so it didn’t go that well.</em></p>
<p><em>“My positioning, the slabs weren’t really that good, but my training during the winter went really well and I found a better way to move on the boulders and I think this was the key to break through in a senior event.”</em></p>
<p>France’s Paul Jenft produced a personal best result to take the bronze medal and join his training partner Schalck on the podium: <em>“It’s a bit of a relief because all the finals I have done I always end up in fourth, so it’s really cool to make the podium after three finals and three fourth places.”</em></p>
<p>Joking about gold medallist Schalck, Jenft said: <em>“I’m happy but I’m also frustrated because Mejdi always beats me. But he pushes me to be stronger because he’s my friend and we train really well together.”</em></p>
<p>Home nation climbers&nbsp;Fujii Kokoro&nbsp;finished fourth and debutant Anraku Sorato finished just behind in fifth. South Korea’s Chon Jongwon was sixth.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;IFSC World Cup&nbsp;will now move on to Seoul, South Korea&nbsp;from 28-30 April with the Boulder and Speed disciplines.</p>

			<title>MENTAL STRENGTH HELPS FRANCE’S JENFT TOP SEMI-FINAL</title>
			<link>https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/news/920-mental-strength-helps-france-s-jenft-top-semi-final</link>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cdn.ifsc-climbing.org/images/News/2023/04_APR/230423_IFSC_News_Mental_strength_helps_frances_jenft_top_qualification_PREV.jpg" /></p><p>Paul Jenft of France finished in pole position in the men’s Boulder semi-finals at the&nbsp;IFSC World Cup Hachioji 2023&nbsp;as one of only two climbers to top two boulders.</p>

<p>South Korea’s Chon Jongwon was the other athlete to top two boulders and also goes through to the final.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite leading the way into the final six, Jenft wasn’t feeling in peak condition for the semi-finals:&nbsp;<em>“I’m really happy with my performance. It was a hard round and the boulders were really physical. I felt a little bit weak in that round, but my mind was really strong. I was able to get two tops and I was happy with that.”</em></p>
<p>Even as top of the leaderboard, Jenft didn’t have any explanation for his lack of strength:&nbsp;<em>“You train to be strong and some days it just doesn’t work, you just feel a bit weak. And today was one of those days.</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>“After the first two boulders I didn’t have any tops and I thought they were more my style. The last two weren’t so much, so I had to be mentally strong to do those last two. But I am happy to make it through to the final.”&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Just behind Jenft and Jongwon in first and second, the hot new property in Japanese climbing, Anraku Sorato, again showed his potential by leading the home nation hunt for a medal qualifying in third.</p>
<p>There will be two French and two Japanese athletes in the final as Mejdi Schalck, qualifying in fourth position, joins compatriot Jenft and Fujii Kokoro, in sixth, joins young gun Sorato.</p>
<p>In August 2022 Sorato was picking up a bronze medal in the Youth A category of the Youth World Championships. At the same time Belgium’s Hannes Van Duysen was picking up Junior gold. They will now be fighting it out for IFSC World Cup medals with Van Duysen also through to the final in fifth position.</p>

			<title>USA’S RABOUTOU CLAIMS FIRST EVER IFSC BOULDER WORLD CUP GOLD</title>
			<link>https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/news/919-usa-s-raboutou-claims-first-ever-ifsc-boulder-world-cup-gold</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/news/919-usa-s-raboutou-claims-first-ever-ifsc-boulder-world-cup-gold</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cdn.ifsc-climbing.org/images/News/2023/04_APR/230422_IFSC_News_Raboutou_claims_first_ever_IFSC_Boulder_World_Cup_gold_PREV.jpg" /></p><p>American Brooke Raboutou’s smile lit the&nbsp;Esforta Arena Hachioji today&nbsp;after claiming her first ever IFSC Boulder World Cup gold medal.</p>

<p>Raboutou was head and shoulders above her competition in Hachioji, Japan, gaining confidence every time she climbed. The USA climber topped three boulders and hit four zones in the final with her closest rival only managing a single top.</p>
<p>Germany’s Hannah Meul was that rival, and she claimed the silver ahead of the home nation favourite Matsufuji Anon who took bronze.</p>
<p>The final was contested by six athletes who had never won an IFSC Boulder World Cup so a new gold medallist was guaranteed. In fact, the last 17&nbsp;IFSC&nbsp;World&nbsp;Cup Boulder events&nbsp;have been won by&nbsp;either USA’s&nbsp;Natalia&nbsp;Grossman or Slovenia’s&nbsp;Janja&nbsp;Garnbret and you have to go back to IFSC World Cup Vail 2018 to find another winner when Alex Puccio of USA won gold.</p>
<p>In disbelief of her maiden gold, Raboutou said:&nbsp;<em>“It’s crazy. I feel a lot. It hasn’t really sunk. I knew I had one when I topped the last boulder, but even then, I was like ‘are you sure?’. Most of all I just feel thankful and really happy with my climbing today.”</em></p>
<p>Well known through the climbing community, Raboutou’s family are a big influence, and she becomes the second generation to claim a World Cup gold after mum Robyn Erbesfield-Raboutou:&nbsp;<em>“I called my parents and they are very, very happy. My mum just told me she was really proud of me, but I feel that every day with them anyway.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>“As much as winning a World Cup was a big dream for me, I had to thank my parents because they got me here and they get me up the wall.”</em></p>
<p>The only other athlete to top a finals Boulder, Meul, was excited not only for her podium finish, but what lies ahead in the coming months:&nbsp;<em>“It’s amazing. I’m super happy to start the season like this. It’s definitely the best start. I had the perfect mixture of being nervous, but also confident in my climbing and what I am capable of.”</em></p>
<p>Despite the happiness picking up a medal, there was also a touch of sadness and reflection as she celebrated the life of teammate Christoph Schweiger who dies recently in a road traffic accident:&nbsp;“This competition was the hardest emotionally. The most important thing in this competition was to carry my teammate Christoph Schweiger in my heart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“He was supposed to be here to climb and show what he could do. So, it was important to enjoy this gift that we have to be here and climb. The love we have and all share for climbing is something that cannot die, so I wanted to chase that spirit for him. He gave me a lot of power in the end.”</p>
<p>Rounding out the podium was Anon who gave the cheering home crowd a greater opportunity to raise their voice when it was confirmed she would leave Hachioji with a World Cup bronze.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fourth place was&nbsp;Ayala Kerem from Israel who secured her best ever IFSC World Cup Boulder finish. China’s Luo&nbsp;Zhilu&nbsp;finished in fifth with Mia Krampl of Slovenia in sixth.</p>
<p>IFSC World Cup Hachioji 2023 will finish tomorrow (Sunday 23 April) with the men’s Boulder semi-final at 11:00 (UTC+9:00) and final at 17:00 (UTC+9:00).</p>

			<title>MEUL LEADS THE WAY FOR HACHIOJI BOULDER FINAL</title>
			<link>https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/news/918-meul-leads-the-way-for-hachioji-boulder-final</link>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cdn.ifsc-climbing.org/images/News/2023/04_APR/230422_IFSC_News_Meul_leads_the_way_for_hachioji_boulder_finalsPREV.jpg" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Germany’s Hannah Meul continued her strong finish to the 2022 season by leading the way into the IFSC World Cup Hachioji 2023 Boulder finals.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The German climber has been working hard all winter and is in Hachioji to prove to herself, and others, last year was not just a one-off: <em>“The hardest part about climbing is the expectations you put on yourself, but I also felt because of having a good year last year people expect more from me – it is a bit hard and you feel a bit of pressure but I actually enjoyed it.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“I enjoy being back in public and showing what I worked on all over winter. I really wanted to be back in competition, and it actually feels a bit like coming home and more fun. All the simulation competitions are great, but I felt much more pressure in them actually.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“Standing on the mat and looking up at the wall is where I feel at home. I’m so glad to be back, it’s so much fun.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meul topped two boulders and hit four zones, the same as Luo Zhilu of China, who goes through in second, and Brooke Raboutou of USA who is third.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is home nation interest in the final with&nbsp;Matsufuji Anon&nbsp;who goes through in fourth position, just ahead of Israel’s Ayala&nbsp;Kerem.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mia Krampl of Slovenia completes the final six finishing just ahead of Noa Shiran. Before Hachioji Shiran’s personal best was 45<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;position, so a strong and exciting start for the 2023 season for the Israeli climber.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some big names like Nonaka Miho, Natalia Grossman and Jessica Pilz miss out on finals in the first event of the season.</p>

			<title>STRONG JAPANESE SEMI-FINAL PRESENCE AFTER HACHIOJI QUALIFICATION </title>
			<link>https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/news/917-strong-japanese-semi-final-presence-after-hachioji-qualification</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/news/917-strong-japanese-semi-final-presence-after-hachioji-qualification</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cdn.ifsc-climbing.org/images/News/2023/04_APR/230421_IFSC_News_qualification_gets_underway_in_HachiojiPREV.jpg" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The IFSC World Cup Hachioji 2023 got underway today with qualification in both the men’s and women’s Boulder.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>WOMEN'S QUALIFICATION</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting the event started was Japan’s Nonaka Miho and USA’s Natalia Grossman, who is on a run of five consecutive IFSC World Cup Boulder wins, for the women’s qualification.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With 74 climbers competing in the women’s competition, the athletes were split into two groups – group A and group B. Because of a tie for tenth position in Group B, 21 athletes progressed through to the semi-finals which take place tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Climbers handle being the first on the mat for a competition differently, for 2022 IFSC World Cup Boulder Series champion Grossman, it’s not something she particularly enjoys:&nbsp;<em>“I never really like going first, it feels weird to be out on your own at the start, but I guess it’s fine.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Talking about her goals for the event, Grossman said:&nbsp;<em>“Just being out here and getting to compete again after a really long time.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>"I’ve been focusing a lot more on Lead the past couple of months, and so there’s always a little bit of sacrifice when you focus on one discipline more than the other, but it’s exciting to get to test myself again on some new boulders.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both Miho and Grossman made it through to the semi-finals with the Japanese climber taking top spot alongside compatriot Matsufuji Anon and Grossman in fifth alongside another Japanese climber, Sekikawa Melody.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Israel’s Ayala Kerem and USA’s Brooke Raboutou move through&nbsp;to semi-finals in third which will feature eight home nation athletes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Full women's Boulder qualification results can be found <a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/world-competition/calendar/?task=resultathletes&amp;event=1291&amp;result=7">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>MEN'S QUALIFICATION</strong></p>
<p>Ninety-six men competed in the Boulder qualification with the Japanese climbers dominating the top five across the two groups – group A and group B.</p>
<p>Narasaki Tomoa excelled in group B topping all five boulders and progressing in first position alongside South Korea’s Lee Dohyun who also managed to top all problems in group A.</p>
<p>Ogata Yoshiyuki was a little nervous before competing but settled down once he got on to the mat. The Japanese climber also topped all five of the Boulders in Group A and qualified for semi-finals in third.</p>
<p>Talking of the pressure of competing on home soil, Yoshiyuki said: <em>“I was nervous about climbing in Japan as I was the champion last year and there may be a little bit of pressure, but I’m quite happy now because I know my friends and family will come to support me on the final day.”</em></p>
<p>Yoshiyuki was also happy that his country opened the season saying: <em>“It’s fun. I think the walls in Japan are a little bit different to other places in the world so it’s good to have the first World Cup of the season here.”</em></p>
<p>Also progressing in third was teammate Fujii Kokoro with 16-year-old Anraku Sorato making it four in the top five for the Asian country.</p>
<p>European Boulder champion Nicolai Uznik of Austria also progressed to the semi-final which will take place on Sunday 23 April.</p>

			<title>IFSC WORLD CUP HACHIOJI 2023: Q&amp;A WITH NOGUCHI AKIYO</title>
			<link>https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/news/916-ifsc-world-cup-hachioji-2023-q-a-with-noguchi-akiyo</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/news/916-ifsc-world-cup-hachioji-2023-q-a-with-noguchi-akiyo</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cdn.ifsc-climbing.org/images/News/2023/04_APR/230421_IFSC_News_hachioji_qanda_with_noguchi_akiyoPREV.jpg" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;">With the IFSC World Cup Hachioji 2023 starting, we had a quick catch-up with someone who knows a thing or two about climbing, and climbing in Japan, Olympic bronze medallist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/component/ifsc/?task=athlete.display&amp;id=2253">Noguchi Akiyo</a>, for some thoughts on the event and her ones-to-watch.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>You stepped away from competing on the World Cup circuit last year, what did you do with your time?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Climbing is still a big part of my life.&nbsp;I&nbsp;hold climbing classes for children and adults as well as climbing events and competitions.&nbsp;In addition, I am spending a lot of time doing TV appearances and at events other than climbing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Did you follow the IFSC World Cup last year?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I do TV commentary in Japan, and of course, I support the Japanese team, so I watch all the World Cup events, whether it's Lead, Boulder, or Speed, as much as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Do you still have contact with the Japanese Climbing team?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the climbers come to practice at the gym in my parents' house, and I go to the domestic competitions and talk with members of the Japanese Climbing team there. I always watch Tomoa and Meichi (Narasaki) training as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What are your memories from Hachioji?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&nbsp;was&nbsp;second at the World Cup held for the first time in Hachioji in 2017. And then I won the 2018 World Cup. At the 2019 World Championships, I placed second in Boulder and second in the Combined, and that place secured me qualification for the Olympics. So, a lot of good memories for me from Hachioji.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What advice would you give athletes competing, maybe for the first time in Hachioji?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hachioji is a big city, so you can enjoy a good dinner after climbing – I’d recommend that. Also, I hear that the tickets for the event are sold out, so I think it's going to be a wonderful environment with a lot of spectators so try to enjoy the experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Who should we look out for in Hachioji, who are the ones-to-watch?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the&nbsp;men's it has to be Sorato Anraku for me. He won the Boulder &amp; Lead&nbsp;Japan Cup the other day and I believe he is a 16-year-old who will challenge for World Cup medals this year. Expectations are high to see how well he can demonstrate his abilities in international competitions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The woman, well obviously it’s Japan's ace, Miho Nonaka.&nbsp;I'm sure she will be involved in the fight all year, right from the first event in Hachioji.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What about the whole season, who are your ones-to-watch there?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the men's event, I’m picking France's Méjdi Schalck.&nbsp;With Paris 2024 coming up, the young French ace will be under a little bit of pressure, but I’m sure he will give some great performances.　</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the women's side, it might seem like a popular opinion, but I'm really looking forward to the return of Janja Garmbret of Slovenia. I often see her training on social media, and I really respect her for being strong every year. I want to see her back performing at the competitions soon.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cdn.ifsc-climbing.org/images/News/2023/04_APR/230420_IFSC_News_-_Hachioji_set_to_host_IFSC_World_Cup_Series_2023_opener_PREV.jpg" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The 2023 IFSC World Cup Series kicks off in Hachioji, Japan, this weekend as competitors from around the world compete for the first World Cup medals of the year.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Taking place from 21 to 23 April, 171 athletes&nbsp;– 95 male and 76 female – representing 40 countries and territories will battle it out in Boulder at the Esforta Arena Hachioji – the venue of the IFSC World Championships in 2019.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking through the <a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/world-competition/calendar?task=starters&amp;event=1291">start list</a> of competitors, <a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/component/ifsc/?task=athlete.display&amp;id=1803">Natalia Grossman</a> of the USA immediately leaps from the page with a run of five consecutive wins in the 2022 Boulder World Cup competitions – only Slovenian Janja Garnbret beat the American last season at the opener in Meiringen, Switzerland.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grossman is joined by a strong American contingent that includes young gun <a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/component/ifsc/?task=athlete.display&amp;id=13021">Anastasia Sanders</a>, the 2022 and 2021 Youth Worlds champion, and Olympian <a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/component/ifsc/?task=athlete.display&amp;id=1811">Brooke Raboutou</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Germany’s <a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/component/ifsc/?task=athlete.display&amp;id=3113">Hannah Meul</a> finished the 2022 Boulder season strongly with two Boulder silver medals in Brixen, Italy, and Innsbruck, Austria, and will hope the run of medals continues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While Grossman dominated the women’s Boulder podium last season, the men’s was totally different with six different gold medallists from the six competitions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Japan was well represented throughout the Boulder season with <a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/component/ifsc/?task=athlete.display&amp;id=2276">Narasaki Tomoa</a> and <a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/component/ifsc/?task=athlete.display&amp;id=2309">Ogata Yoshiyuki</a> both picking up a full set of gold, silver and bronze medals, and are part of a large Japanese contingent of 12 climbers in the men’s event.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">European Boulder champion <a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/component/ifsc/?task=athlete.display&amp;id=1256">Nicolai Uznik</a> of Austria, Olympic champion <a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/component/ifsc/?task=athlete.display&amp;id=811">Alberto&nbsp;Ginés López</a>&nbsp;of Spain, and Youth Worlds champion <a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/component/ifsc/?task=athlete.display&amp;id=373">Hannes Van Duysen</a> are all in Hachoiji to see if they can add to their titles and begin the year on a high.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From athletes with plenty of World Cup experience under their belts, to some with none. While there is a host of new young climbers taking their first steps in World Cup competitions, Pilipinas Climbing have brought three World Cup newbies for the 2023 kick off.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/component/ifsc/?task=athlete.display&amp;id=3830">Iman Mora</a>, 34, and <a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/component/ifsc/?task=athlete.display&amp;id=3834">John Joseph Veloria</a>, 30, make their World Cup debuts in the men’s Boulder with teammate <a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/component/ifsc/?task=athlete.display&amp;id=3832">Nicole Liana Mora</a>, 32, making hers in the women’s – all proving age is just a number.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cdn.ifsc-climbing.org/images/News/2023/04_APR/230412_IFSC_News_-_IFSC_deeply_saddened_by_the_tragic_loss_of_Christoph_Schweiger_PREV.jpg" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is with great sadness that the IFSC learned of the&nbsp;tragic loss&nbsp;of climber Christoph Schweiger&nbsp;in a road traffic accident&nbsp;at the age of 21.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">From Ingolstadt in Bavaria, Germany, Christoph was a regular on the IFSC World Cup circuit after making his debut at the IFSC World Cup Hachioji in 2018. Mainly focusing on the Boulder discipline, Christoph was part of the German team at the IFSC Youth World Championships competing at three editions between 2017 and 2019. In 2016 Christoph claimed three Boulder medals at the European Youth Cup events with a gold in Graz, Austria and silver in Soure, Portugal and Warsaw, Poland.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">IFSC President Marco Scolaris said: “For someone to lose their life so young in this way is heart-breaking. My thoughts, and everyone’s at the IFSC, are with Christoph’s family, his&nbsp;friends, the Deutscher Alpenverein,&nbsp;and the whole climbing community.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Delegates from the 46 National Federations were presented with the IFSC 2022 Annual Report which was introduced by the IFSC President Marco Scolaris. He highlighted some of the achievements of the year including climbing’s introduction to the European Championships in Munich, Germany and the successful IFSC Climbing Summit. He encouraged the delegates to read the report which includes messages from the IFSC leadership, a review of the 2022 IFSC season, the financial reports, and a summary of the work of the National Federations and IFSC staff.

<p style="text-align: justify;">IFSC General Director Piero Rebaudengo presented the new IFSC staff structure and the plan for an&nbsp;IFSC subsidiary for the promotion of Sport Climbing through the commercialisation of its events which will be proposed for a vote at the end of 2023. The IFSC Treasurer Pierre You gave some additional insights on the value of a subsidiary before he presented the financial report which was subsequently approved by delegates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before the Continental Councils delivered their annual reports, IFSC Secretary General Debra Gawrych presented the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF) Integrity Unit. She highlighted the extra support the new unit can offer the IFSC for the development of its policies before introducing three candidates for the newly reformed IFSC Ethics Commission,&nbsp;USA's Patti Rube, Ethiopian Dagmawit Girmay Berhane and Italian Mario Morelli who were all approved by the delegates.</p>

This was followed by a presentation from IFSC Vice-President Kobinata Toru who provided updates regarding Paris 2024 and the Olympic Qualifier Series that will begin early next year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A proposal to change the age eligibility from age 16 to 17 for the senior IFSC events, which includes the World Cups and World Championships, from 2025 onwards was put to the delegates with 57% voting in favour.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Olympian and Athletes’ Commission President Shauna Coxsey spoke passionately about the value that athletes give to having positions on the board and representation throughout the IFSC Commissions structure. She also shared the focus of the Athletes’ Commission for 2023, Speed and Boulder formats, athlete health and fairness and inclusion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new IFSC Media and Communications Director Fabrizio Rossini delivered his strategy for the future which includes a new user-friendly website and a focus on internal communications with the Federations and a new approach to content which showcases the athletes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The final report of the General Assembly was given by the IFSC Development Director Silvia Verdolini who highlighted the value of the development programmes including the World Climbing Academy, the Women in Sport High Performance Pathway, and the routesetter clinics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to the closing remarks from the IFSC President, delegates were asked to vote for the hosts of the 2024 and 2025 General Assemblies, which were duly awarded to Santiago in 2024 and Cyprus in 2025 after presentations from Willy Montenegro, President of the Chilean Climbing Federation, and Pavlos Georgiades, President of Cyprus Mountaineering Climbing&nbsp;&amp; Orienteering.</p>

His final act of the busy two days was to thank the hosts of the General Assembly, all the delegates who actively participated and the IFSC staff for their continued hard work and dedication.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />On hand to welcome the delegates was IFSC President Marco Scolaris, who thanked the&nbsp;Singapore Sport Climbing and Mountaineering Federation for hosting the annual event during his address and went on to highlight the importance of coming together and shaping the vision and long-term success of the sport.&nbsp;<br /><br />International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach spoke to the attendees via video message, in which he acknowledged the work done by the IFSC in planning for the future and for its excellent preparations for the Olympic Games Paris 2024, specifically referencing the Olympic Qualifier Series (OQS), a new IOC-led Olympic qualification event hosted in compact city centre venues over four days between March and June 2024 that will include four sports – BMX freestyle, breaking, skateboarding, and Sport Climbing.&nbsp;<br /><br />“We are excited to have the&nbsp;IFSC and the Sport Climbing community on board for this innovative festival of sport and culture,” President Bach said. “Bringing sport to where the people are and highlighting the achievements of the athletes on their road to Paris 2024. In doing so you are once again leading by example, and this is something you can all be very, very proud of.”&nbsp;<br /><br />Bach continued: “From the OQS to promoting gender equality, to strengthening clean sport or developing robust safeguarding measures, at the IFSC you are promoting sport and its values in an exemplary way.”&nbsp;To see the full message from President Bach&nbsp;click&nbsp;<a title="https://ifsc-climbing.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6196bad354e3ecf21c549d32a&amp;id=1c1869a18e&amp;e=ebc07658c0" href="https://ifsc-climbing.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6196bad354e3ecf21c549d32a&amp;id=1c1869a18e&amp;e=ebc07658c0" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ogsc="rgb(0, 0, 0)">here</a>.<br /><br />The General Assembly voted to accept five new National Federations from Iceland, Kosovo, Kuwait, Lebanon, and Morocco, bringing the total number to 99 members.

			<title>VOTE OPENS DOOR FOR PRESIDENT SCOLARIS TO RUN IN 2025</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cdn.ifsc-climbing.org/images/News/2023/03_MAR/310323_IFSC_News_Federations_vote_opens_door_for_President_Scolaris_to_run_in_2025_PREV.jpg" /></p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">The IFSC General Assembly in Singapore voted for a proposed exception which would allow current President Marco Scolaris to&nbsp;stand again for a&nbsp;final term in the 2025 General Election.</span></span><span class="eop"><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></p>

<p class="paragraph" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">Alongside the Presidency vote, Federations requested a succession plan from the IFSC Executive Board that would ensure a smooth transition when new leadership is confirmed.</span></span><span class="eop"><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">The need for an exception was passed with 71% of votes cast.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">President Scolaris said: “We are a close family, and we are an open family. Throughout the first day of our General Assembly our Federation representatives have listened, discussed, and more importantly, asked the questions they have needed to make their decisions.</span></span><span class="eop"><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">“Because of this, I know thought and consideration has gone into this vote and it would be my privilege to consider representing our members and carry on in our Olympic journey after 2025.”&nbsp;</span></span><span class="eop"><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">When the IFSC was founded in 2007, and Scolaris subsequently named President in 2009, the Federation’s long-term goal was to showcase Sport Climbing at the 2028 Games. The IFSC has grown rapidly in a short space of time and surpassed its goal to debut at Tokyo 2020 – two editions earlier than envisaged.</span></span><span class="eop"><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">With the accelerated completion of the Olympic objectives, the goals and needs of the IFSC have shifted to ensure a smooth transition from a pandemic effected Games, to an additional sport at Paris 2024, to a programme sport in Los Angeles.</span></span><span class="eop"><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">Success and exponential growth have again been recognised as a factor among stakeholders leading to the decision for the exception.</span></span><span class="eop"><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">Held at the Swissôtel The Stamford, the workshops featured a number of presentations and roundtable discussions led by top-level presenters from the world of sport and health.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">With Climbing still new to the Olympic family, Joop Alberda, the gold-medal winning coach of the Netherlands men’s Olympic volleyball team, walked the delegates through what it takes to be in the Olympic environment and how best to assist athletes and Federations on the Olympic path.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">Boasting an extensive CV in coaching and sports administration inside the Olympic Movement, Alberda broke down his vast experience in athletics, swimming, rowing, volleyball, cycling and football in an easy-to-follow journey through the Olympic lifecycle.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">Alberda conceptualised the journey of Climbing in the Olympics as a journey with stops along the way. He provided a recap of Tokyo 2020, where Climbing made its Olympic debut, before looking ahead to Paris 2024, which he said will give Sport Climbing a much more realistic Olympic experience than at Tokyo 2020, which was held during the coronavirus pandemic and featured numerous restrictions.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">Focusing more on National Federations, Alberda worked through the key components of high-performance sport and outlined the values involved before focusing attention on potential future changes that may impact them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">With new Federations forming around the world and others expanding, Alberda took time to introduce high-performance culture and offered points on how it can be created within organisations.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">Dr Margo Mountjoy, a sport medicine doctor, scientist and professor with experience at the Olympic Games and Youth Olympic Games, discussed her expertise in </span><span data-contrast="auto">relative energy deficiency in sport</span><span data-contrast="auto"> (RED-S) </span><span data-contrast="auto">while presenting the most common </span><span data-contrast="auto">signs and symptoms to help raise awareness.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Mountjoy also </span><span data-contrast="auto">updated the participants on the latest outcomes from the IOC RED-S consensus  statement.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">Maria Stefania Ionel&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">brought the RED-S workshop to a close with a "</span><span data-contrast="auto">Consensus Statement on </span><span data-contrast="auto">​</span><span data-contrast="auto">Eating Disorders in Climbing"</span><span data-contrast="auto">.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">Taking attendees on another journey, this time through TAP and his own personal experiences, Parfitt looked at the challenges within Climbing and the importance of legacy and what the Federations may want to leave behind.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0}"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">As a group there were reflections and memories from the Federations about Climbing before feedback about those experiences. The next step in the workshop was how those experiences could potentially change for the better for&nbsp;future generations. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0}"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">Parfitt welcomed Athletes' Commission representatives Shauna Coxsey and Sean McColl to his session to give a first-hand elite perspective and add further insight from the top end of the sport.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0}"></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The same format was replicated twice at the beginning of 2023, with two more Clinics organised in Kaunas, Lithuania, from 13 to 16 February; and Athens, Greece, from 2 to 5 March.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The IFSC Routesetters’ Clinic in Kaunas was conducted by IFSC Routesetter Tonde Katyio and saw the participation of 12 trainees – including five women.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://cdn.ifsc-climbing.org/images/News/2023/03_MAR/230329_IFSC_News_-_World_Climbing_Academy_holds_pair_of_Routesetters_Clinics_in_Lithuania_and_Greece_01.jpg" alt="230329 IFSC News World Climbing Academy holds pair of Routesetters Clinics in Lithuania and Greece 01" width="800" height="600" /><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Participants of the IFSC Routesetters' Clinic in Kaunas</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Photo: LLSF</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“</em><em>Many questions were asked and so many relevant discussions happened during the 4 days route setters' training with Tonde Katyio</em><em>,”</em> said participant Aušrinė Balkaitytė. <em>“</em><em>From practical tips and tricks to philosophical approaches. From 1</em><em>2</em><em> strangers to getting to know each other at least a tiny bit better. And we strongly believe that something beautiful or at least interesting will grow out of this experience in the future!</em><em>”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“</em><em>The workshop experience was undoubtedly one of the best things that happened </em><em>to the</em><em> Lithuanian </em><em>C</em><em>limbing community </em><em>in</em><em> a long time</em><em>,”</em> added Dainius Saržickas. <em>“</em><em>For </em><em>a </em><em>beginner routesetter </em><em>like</em><em> me, Tonde gave me motivation, methods and different understanding of our craft. I would definitely like to experience something similar in my future as routesetter.</em><em>”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Clinic organised in Athens featured the same training team that conducted the course in Ibarra – Matthias Woitzuk and Mauro Schwatszta – and saw the participation of a group of athletes from the Greek national team.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t0Otz1KWI9I" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The two Routesetters’ Clinics were structured around 10 key evaluation points: safety, teamwork, communication, time management, setting methodology, setting craft, creativity, forerunning and athletic empathy, self-evaluation as a climber, and work ethic. attitudeand saw the participation of 12 trainees.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each participant left their Clinic with a goal, or a task to be performed in the following weeks and months – like setting for a mock event, or at National level, creating a specific route or problem, or simply upgrading their level of setting. Follow-up interviews with the respective trainers will be scheduled to check in on the trainees’ progress.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cdn.ifsc-climbing.org/images/News/Placeholders/IFSC_News_-_Paris_placeholder_PREV.jpg" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Climbing fans will be able to cycle from the centre of Paris to Seine-Saint-Denis, the home of the Sport Climbing venue, to catch a glimpse of the stars of our sport in Olympic action as 55-kilometres of new bike lanes are set to be completed by July 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Scheduled for 26 July to 11 August, Paris 2024 will be Sport Climbing’s second outing at an Olympic Games following a hugely successful debut at Tokyo 2020 with competition taking place at the Le Bourget Climbing venue situated in the north-eastern suburb of the city – an area known for its young population.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose-built venue and indoor Climbing facilities in Seine-Saint-Denis will provide a lasting legacy after the Games which goes hand in hand with Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo’s vision for the additional bike lanes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finished in time for next summer’s sporting showpiece, the French capital city announced&nbsp;25 kilometres of new ‘Olympilanes’ will span the Seine-Saint-Denis area in addition to the 30 kilometres of cycling routes in Paris already in place or is about to be completed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">IFSC President Marco Scolaris said: “We can’t wait to see the final plan of the cycle lane network and we would be delighted to ride from Paris city centre to our venue, together with our athletes.”</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cdn.ifsc-climbing.org/images/News/2023/03_MAR/230308_IFSC_News_-_Climbing_coaches_from_Greece_Singapore_and_the_USA_participated_in_the_residency_phase_of_the_WISH_programme_PREV.jpg" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;">From 20 to 24 February, a group of female coaches that included three Sport Climbing representatives gathered at the Institute of Sport at the University of Hertfordshire, Great Britain, for the five days of residency that enhanced their participation in the Women in Sport High Performance Pathway (WISH) programme.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Stella Kerasidou of Greece, Beatrix Chong of Singapore, and Meghan McDonald of the USA were selected by the IFSC, to be part of the group of 97 coaches from 53 countries and 17 sports that have enrolled in the programme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Supported by Olympic Solidarity funding, WISH is a four-year programme designed to equip around 100 women to coach at elite levels by 2024, helping them develop their leadership skills, confidence and careers. Coaches also benefit from one-to-one leadership mentoring, plus ongoing support from a sport-specific mentor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“</em><em>It </em><em>was</em><em> a great honour getting selected as </em><em>one</em><em> of the </em><em>three coaches</em><em> to represent Sport Climbing </em><em>in the</em><em> WISH programme</em><em>,”</em> said Chong. <em>“I had the chance</em><em> of sharing session with women from other sports and nationalities</em><em>, and the</em> <em>f</em><em>acilitator c</em><em>ame</em><em> up with a variety of activities to help bring out the leadership and teamwork in us</em><em>,</em> <em>a</em><em>ssisting us to acknowledge our strength and weakness. </em><em>I am very much l</em><em>ooking forward to seeing how much more I can grow as a coach after this program</em><em>!”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kerasidou said: <em>“I really liked </em><em>that I came close with female coaches from all around the world and s</em><em>aw</em><em> that they have the same concerns as me</em><em>,</em><em> and they face the same problems. So it makes me feel that it's not something that I'm doing wrong</em><em>,</em><em> but that all these difficulties </em><em>really </em><em>exist. </em><em>I</em><em> like how we are coming closer, and we </em><em>are </em><em>learn</em><em>ing</em><em> from each other</em><em>’s</em><em> experiences. And</em> <em>the tasks we </em><em>did </em><em>in the program</em><em>me</em><em> help</em><em>ed</em><em> us to understand better the different situations and from different perspectives.</em><em>”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“It’s been a wonderful opportunity. I was thrilled to be in that cohort of amazingly talented female coaches and leaders. There’s so much wisdom, experience, and kindness! I’m eager to expand my breadth of knowledge and to push my capacity as a coach and a leader,”</em> said McDonald.</p>
